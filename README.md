- [X] Create simulator predicting dropoff rates given 
  -  labmda, the expected number of bids after which freelancers dropoff
  -  total number of bids
  -  the global probability of winning a bid
- [ ] Create [synthetic dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZOVJN6Q4ahPto4foE-9o_Tr9i7GGNbvpcVODUxxQm84/edit#gid=0) of freelancers who bid and drop off according to a predetermined set of the 3 parameters above
- [ ] Train (supervised) learning model to predict these parameters 
  - [ ] Determine what type of learning model is most appropriate?
- [ ] Estimate effects of intervention after bids
